# 🏛️ OLYMPIA CUSTOM SERVICES

## Overview

Olympia Custom Services is a modular Python-based platform for Gloryteam gameshow based on the gameshow Road to mount Olympia.  
It uses **Docker** for containerization and **PostgreSQL** for data storage, providing APIs and services for media management, data analysis, and bot automation.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Modular Architecture** – Clear separation into `src`, `agent`, and `ocbot` modules.
- **RESTful APIs** – Versioned API endpoints for maintainability.
- **Database Integration** – PostgreSQL with configuration and SQL scripts.
- **Media & Data Management** – Supports audio, video, images, PDFs, and tabular data.
- **Bot Automation** – Built-in bot framework for automated workflows.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – Interactive analysis and prototyping.
- **Dockerized Deployment** – Consistent, portable environments using Docker Compose.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+
- (Optional) PostgreSQL client tools

---

### ⚙️ Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NgocDuy3112/OLYMPIA_CUSTOM_SERVICES.git
   cd system
   ```

2. **Start services using Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -p olympia-custom up --build
   ```

3. **Access the platform:**
   - API endpoints: [http://localhost:8000/api/v1/](http://localhost:8000/api/v1/)
   - Open `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` for data exploration.

## 🗄️ Database

- PostgreSQL data lives in `data/postgresql/`.
- SQL scripts for table creation and management are in `sql/`.

---

## 🛠 Development

Main application code is in `src/`.

To install dependencies for each service:
```bash
pip install -r <service>/requirements.txt
```
Where `<service>` can be **app**, **agent**, or **ocbot**.
